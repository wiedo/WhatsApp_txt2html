# WhatsApp_txt2html
Converts the WhatsApp chat exports from a txt file to an more readable html file.

If you go to a conversation in the iPhone whatsapp app and tap the title you have an option to export the conversation, this exports a very crude .txt export with all media files in the same folder. This script helps to change that file to a more readable HTML file.

Copy the whatsapp-modify.sh file to the export folder and run it (bash whatsapp-modify.sh in terminal).

Currently (and probably forever) it's very basic. It changes the jpg links to clickable links to open a lightbox with the actual photo.

It would be cool if somebody branches this to something actually good because I endlessly searched for something like this and ended up buying a dedicated app.
